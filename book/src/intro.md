# Pitboss

Pitboss is a Rust toolkit for running and observing **parallel Claude Code sessions**. A dispatcher (`pitboss`) fans out `claude` subprocesses under a concurrency cap, captures structured artifacts per run, and — in hierarchical mode — lets a **lead** dynamically spawn more workers via MCP. The TUI (`pitboss-tui`) gives the floor view: tile grid, live log tailing, budget and token counters.

Language models are stochastic. A well-run pit is not.

## What pitboss does

| Primitive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Flat dispatch** | Declare N tasks up front; pitboss runs them in parallel under a concurrency cap. Each task runs in its own git worktree on its own branch. |
| **Hierarchical dispatch** | Declare one lead; the lead observes the situation and dynamically spawns workers via MCP tools, under budget and worker-cap guardrails you set. |
| **Depth-2 sub-leads** | *(v0.6+)* A root lead may spawn sub-leads, each with its own envelope and isolated coordination layer. Useful for multi-phase projects that each need their own context. |
| **Container dispatch** | *(v0.8+)* `pitboss container-dispatch` runs dispatch inside a Docker/Podman container with declarative bind mounts — project directory, reference material, `~/.claude` auth. |
| **Operator control** | Cancel, pause, freeze, or reprompt workers live. Gate actions on operator approval. The TUI shows everything in real time. |
| **Structured artifacts** | Every run produces per-task logs, token usage, session ids, and a `summary.json`. Nothing disappears when the terminal closes. |

## Current version

**v0.12.0** — typed worker/sublead profiles (#252) and Path B as the default. Declare `[[worker_type]]` or `[[sublead_type]]` blocks with their own tool allowlists, MCP server scopes, and budget caps; the dispatcher enforces caps at spawn time and Path B fast-paths typed callers via `permission_prompt` short-circuit. `[lead].permission_routing` now defaults to `"path_b"`, so spawned claude subprocesses run with their built-in permission gate active rather than relying on `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Operator visibility into denials lands in `pitboss status`, the TUI tile, and `summary.jsonl`; a new `pitboss validate --capability-matrix` prints the actor-type × MCP-server table for pre-dispatch audit. Path-A manifests still work — set `permission_routing = "path_a"` explicitly to keep pre-v0.12 behavior.
