# Pitboss

Pitboss is a Rust toolkit for running and observing **parallel Claude Code sessions**. A dispatcher (`pitboss`) fans out `claude` subprocesses under a concurrency cap, captures structured artifacts per run, and — in hierarchical mode — lets a **lead** dynamically spawn more workers via MCP. The TUI (`pitboss-tui`) gives the floor view: tile grid, live log tailing, budget and token counters.

Language models are stochastic. A well-run pit is not.

## What pitboss does

| Primitive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Flat dispatch** | Declare N tasks up front; pitboss runs them in parallel under a concurrency cap. Each task runs in its own git worktree on its own branch. |
| **Hierarchical dispatch** | Declare one lead; the lead observes the situation and dynamically spawns workers via MCP tools, under budget and worker-cap guardrails you set. |
| **Depth-2 sub-leads** | *(v0.6+)* A root lead may spawn sub-leads, each with its own envelope and isolated coordination layer. Useful for multi-phase projects that each need their own context. |
| **Container dispatch** | *(v0.8+)* `pitboss container-dispatch` runs dispatch inside a Docker/Podman container with declarative bind mounts — project directory, reference material, `~/.claude` auth. |
| **Operator control** | Cancel, pause, freeze, or reprompt workers live. Gate actions on operator approval. The TUI shows everything in real time. |
| **Structured artifacts** | Every run produces per-task logs, token usage, session ids, and a `summary.json`. Nothing disappears when the terminal closes. |

## Current version

**v0.13.0** — `pitboss-web` Graph tab rework (#260) and capability matrix surfacing (#391, #397). The Graph tab persists past run finalize, every node densifies with timestamps / tokens / cost / counters / failure-reason, and clicking any actor opens a side-panel inspector with parent/child click-jump and an inline live log tail (Pretty/Raw stream-json toggle). On the permissions side, per-server `[[mcp_server]].tools` allowlists land both as a schema knob and a runtime enforcement gate, complementing the v0.12 typed-profile allowlists for defense-in-depth narrowing. The resolved capability matrix surfaces in the TUI Detail view, the manifest detail page, and `pitboss validate --capability-matrix`. Tool denials get first-class treatment in the TUI and `pitboss status`; `pitboss validate --container` lets operators pre-flight container manifests from outside the container.
